# AutoDropen
AutoDropen is a fully automatic drop image analysis software in order to study the wetting properties of solid surfaces. It can analyze drop images in batches at one time, and output informations of left contact angle, right contact angle, average contact angle, and drop diameter. This software is developed in **MATLAB**.

AutoDropen is modified and improved base on [Dropen](https://doi.org/10.17632/wzchzbm58p.3) which is developed by Akbari. Therefore, please cite the following papers when you using AutoDropen in your study:
